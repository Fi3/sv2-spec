# 7. Template Distribution Protocol

The Template Distribution protocol is used to receive updates of the block template to use in mining the next block.
It effectively replaces [BIP 22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0022.mediawiki) and [BIP 23](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0023.mediawiki) (`getblocktemplate`) and provides a much more efficient API which allows Bitcoin Core (or some other full node software) to push template updates at more appropriate times as well as provide a template which may be mined on quickly for the block-after-next.
While not recommended, the template update protocol can be a remote server, and is thus authenticated and signed in the same way as all other protocols (using the same SetupConnection handshake).

Like the Job Negotiation and Job Distribution protocols, all Template Distribution messages have the `channel_msg` bit unset, and there is no concept of channels.
After the initial common handshake, the client MUST immediately send a `SetPoolOutputs` message to indicate the space it requires for coinbase output addition, to which the server MUST immediately reply with the current best block template it has available to the client.
Thereafter, the server SHOULD push new block templates to the client whenever the total fee in the current block template increases materially, and MUST send updated block templates whenever it learns of a new block.

Template Providers MUST attempt to broadcast blocks which are mined using work they provided, and thus MUST track the work which they provided to clients.

## 7.1 `SetupConnection` Flags for Template Distribution Protocol

Flags usable in `SetupConnection.flags` and `SetupConnection.Error::flags`, where bit 0 is the least significant bit of the u32 type:

| Field Name               | Bit | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| REQUIRE_TX_SHORT_LIST    | 0   | The client require to receive a tx short hash list for each  new template received.   |
|                          |     | The server  MUST send a `TxShortHashList` for each `NewTemplate`.                     |

When a client send this message the server MUST build and send a `NewTemplate` using the last received pool's
coinbase outputs. If no outputs have been received the server MUST ignore the message.

## 7.5 `TxShortHashList` (Client -> Server)

If client is a `JobDeclarator`, it need to receive a tx short hash list of the transactions that
are in the block candidate for each `NewTemplate`.

## 7.6 `SetNewPrevHash` (Server -> Client)

Upon successful validation of a new best block, the server MUST immediately provide a `SetNewPrevHash` message.
If a `NewMiningJob` message has previously been sent with an empty `min_ntime`, which is valid work based on the `prev_hash` contained in this message, the `template_id` field SHOULD be set to the `job_id` present in that `NewTemplate` message indicating the client MUST begin mining on that template as soon as possible.

TODO: Define how many previous works the client has to track (2? 3?), and require that the server reference one of those in `SetNewPrevHash`.

| Field Name       | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| prev_hash        | U256      | Previous blockâ€™s hash, as it must appear in the next block's header                                                                                                                                    |
| header_timestamp | U32       | The nTime field in the block header at which the client should start (usually current time). This is NOT the minimum valid nTime value.                                                                |
| nBits            | U32       | Block header field                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| target           | U256      | The maximum double-SHA256 hash value which would represent a valid block. Note that this may be lower than the target implied by nBits in several cases, including weak-block based block propagation. |

## 7.7 `RequestTransactionData` (Client -> Server)

A request sent by the Job Negotiator to the Template Provider which requests the set of transaction data for all transactions (excluding the coinbase transaction) included in a block, as well as any additional data which may be required by the Pool to validate the work.

| Field Name  | Data Type | Description                                            |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| template_id | U64       | The template_id corresponding to a NewTemplate message |

## 7.8 `RequestTransactionData.Success` (Server->Client)

A response to `RequestTransactionData` which contains the set of full transaction data and excess data required for validation.
For practical purposes, the excess data is usually the SegWit commitment, however the Job Negotiator MUST NOT parse or interpret the excess data in any way.
Note that the transaction data MUST be treated as opaque blobs and MUST include any SegWit or other data which the Pool may require to verify the transaction.
For practical purposes, the transaction data is likely the witness-encoded transaction today.
However, to ensure backward compatibility, the transaction data MAY be encoded in a way that is different from the consensus serialization of Bitcoin transactions.

Ultimately, having some method of negotiating the specific format of transactions between the Template Provider and the Poolâ€™s Template verification node would be overly burdensome, thus the following requirements are made explicit.
The `RequestTransactionData.Success` sender MUST ensure that the data is provided in a forwards- and backwards-compatible way to ensure the end receiver of the data can interpret it, even in the face of new, consensus-optional data.
This allows significantly more flexibility on both the `RequestTransactionData.Success`-generating and -interpreting sides during upgrades, at the cost of breaking some potential optimizations which would require version negotiation to provide support for previous versions.
For practical purposes, and as a non-normative suggested implementation for Bitcoin Core, this implies that additional consensus-optional data be appended at the end of transaction data.
It will simply be ignored by versions which do not understand it.

To work around the limitation of not being able to negotiate e.g. a transaction compression scheme, the format of the opaque data in `RequestTransactionData.Success` messages MAY be changed in non-compatible ways at the time a fork activates, given sufficient time from code-release to activation (as any sane fork would have to have) and there being some in-Template Negotiation Protocol signaling of support for the new fork (e.g. for soft-forks activated using [BIP 9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki)).

## 7.10 `SubmitSolution` (Client -> Server)

## 7.11 `AllocateTxs` (Client -> Server)

When a pool have a job committed by downstream, it send the tx_short_hash_list of the transactions
that are in the job so that the TP know how to build a block when downstream find a solution.
